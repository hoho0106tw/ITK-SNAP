stack_greedy: Paul's histology stack to MRI registration implementation
Usage:
  stack_greedy recon [cmd_options] <project_dir>
Required Command Options:
  -z <offset> <eps>   : Parameters for the graph-theoretic algorithm. Offset is the 
                        maximum distance in z when slices are considered neighbors.
                        Epsilon is the constant in eq.(2) from Alder et al. 2014, used
                        to control how likely slices are to be skipped
Options Shared with Greedy (see Greedy docs for more info):
  -m metric              : Metric to use for slice matching
  -n NxNxN               : Number of iterations per level of multi-res
  -threads N             : Number of allowed concurrent threads
  -gm-trim <radius>      : Generate mask for gradient computation 
  -search N s_ang s_xyz  : Random search over rigid transforms
